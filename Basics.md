# Day 1

Prolog as the name itself suggests, is the short form of LOGical PROgramming. It is a logical and declarative programming language. Before diving deep into the concepts of Prolog, let us first understand what exactly logical programming is.

Logic Programming is one of the Computer Programming Paradigm, in which the program statements express the facts and rules about different problems within a system of formal logic.


# Logic and Procedural Programming

From this illustration, we can see that in Functional Programming, we have to define the procedures, and the rule how the procedures work. These procedures work step by step to solve one specific problem based on the algorithm. On the other hand, for the Logic Programming, we will provide knowledge base. Using this knowledge base, the machine can find answers to the given questions, which is totally different from functional programming.
