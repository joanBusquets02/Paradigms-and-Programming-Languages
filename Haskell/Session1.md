# Section 1

Learning Haskell is much like learning to program for the first time â€” it's fun! It forces you to think differently.

## What is Haskell?

Haskell is a pure functional programming language. And what exactly functional programming means? 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutability.
It is a declarative style of programming, in which the focus is on describing what the program should do,
rather than how it should be done.

Haskell doesn't have:

- Asigments
```python
a = 2
```
- Loops
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for n in numnbers:
  pass
```
- Side effects
```python
def add1():
  return x + 1 # where x came from?
```
- Memory managment
```cpp
using namespace std;
void geeks()
{
    int var = 20;
  
    // declare pointer variable
    int* ptr;
  
    // note that data type of ptr and var must be same
    ptr = &var;
}
```
